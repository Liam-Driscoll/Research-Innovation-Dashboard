# Requirements

Before you deploy, you must have the following installed on your device:

- [AWS Account](https://aws.amazon.com/account/)
- [GitHub Account](https://github.com/)
- [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)
- [AWS SAM](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-install.html)
- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)

Once you have downloaded docker desktop launch and setup the application. Once the application is setup leave it running.

If you are on a Windows device, it is recommended to install the [Windows Subsystem For Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install), which lets you run a Linux terminal on your Windows computer natively. Some of the steps will require its use. [Windows Terminal](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/windows-terminal/9N0DX20HK701) is also recommended for using WSL.

# Step 1: Clone The Repository

First, clone the GitHub repository onto your machine. To do this:

1. Create a folder on your computer to contain the project code.
2. For an Apple computer, open Terminal. If on a Windows machine, open Command Prompt or Windows Terminal. Enter into the folder you made using the command `cd path/to/folder`. To find the path to a folder on a Mac, right click on the folder and press `Get Info`, then select the whole text found under `Where:` and copy with âŒ˜C. On Windows (not WSL), enter into the folder on File Explorer and click on the path box (located to the left of the search bar), then copy the whole text that shows up.
3. Clone the github repository by entering the following:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/UBC-CIC/Research-Innovation-Dashboard.git
```

The code should now be in the folder you created. Navigate into the folder containing the Amplify project by running the command:

```bash
cd Research-Innovation-Dashboard
```

# Step 2: Frontend Deployment

Before installing Amplify we need to create the IAM Role that gives us the permissions needed to implement this solution. Run the following line of code:

```bash
aws cloudformation deploy --template-file cfn-amplifyRole.yaml --stack-name amplifyconsole-vpri-backend-role --capabilities CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM
```

If you have multiple AWS Profiles, specify one with sufficient admin permissions by appending the following text to the end of the command, replacing the profile name with the profile you would like to use for the solution (If you do this, be sure to include the same `--profile` argument for the rest of the commands starting with `aws`. The profile you are using for this project should have administrator privliges).

```bash
--profile [PROFILE NAME]
```

This step creates the IAM role called **amplifyconsole-vpri-backend-role** that will be used on the next step.

The **Deploy to Amplify Console** button will take you to your AWS console to deploy the front-end solution.

    <img src="https://oneclick.amplifyapp.com/button.svg" alt="Deploy to Amplify Console">
</a>

1. On the AWS console. select your region on the top right, then connect to GitHub.
   ![Amplify console main screen](images/amplifyConsole/amplify-console-01.png)
2. Select the **amplifyconsole-vpri-backend-role** we made previously for the deployment role, and then press `Save and Deploy`![alt text](images/amplifyConsole/amplify-console-02.png)
3. The deployment will take a few minutes. Wait until the status shows **Verify** in green![alt text](images/amplifyConsole/amplify-console-03.png)
4. Click on left taskbar to open menu, click on Rewrites and redirects, and click on edit![alt text](images/amplifyConsole/amplify-console-04.png)
5. Click and replace the first rule's source address (or add a rule if there is none) to `</^((?!\.(css|gif|ico|jpg|js|png|txt|svg|woff|ttf)$).)*$/>`, click and replace target address to `/index.html`, and select and replace **type** with `200 (Rewrite)`, then save. Add a second rule, with the source address as `</^((?!\.(css|gif|ico|jpg|js|png|txt|svg|woff|ttf)$).)*$/>`, the target address as `/index.html`, and the **type** with `404 (Rewrite)`.
   Refer to [AWS's Page on Single Page Apps](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amplify/latest/userguide/redirects.html#redirects-for-single-page-web-apps-spa) for further information on why we did that

# Step 2: Backend Deployment

It's time to set up everything that goes on behind the scenes! For more information on how the backend works, feel free to refer to the Architecture Deep Dive, but an understanding of the backend is not necessary for deployment.

## Step 1: Install Dependencies

The first step is to get into the backend folder. This can be done with the following commands:

```bash
cd back_end
cd cdk
```

Now that you are in the backend directory, install the core dependencies with the following command:

```bash
npm install
```

## Step 2: Upload the Elsevier API Key and Institution Token

While in the backend folder, run the following commands. Ensure you replace "INSTITUTION_TOKEN" in the first command with your own Elsevier institution token and you replace "API_KEY" in the second command with your own Elsevier API key.

```bash
aws ssm put-parameter --name "/service/elsevier/api/user_name/instoken" --value "INSTITUTION_TOKEN" --type SecureString --overwrite
aws ssm put-parameter --name "/service/elsevier/api/user_name/key" --value "API_KEY" --type SecureString --overwrite
```

## Step 3: CDK Deployment

Initialize the CDK stacks (required only if you have not deployed this stack before). Note the CDK deployment assumes you are deploying in ca-central-1

```bash
cdk synth --profile your-profile-name
cdk bootstrap aws://YOUR_AWS_ACCOUNT_ID/ca-central-1 --profile your-profile-name
```

Deploy the CDK stacks (this will take 30-45 minutes):

If you run into any issues while deploying, refer to [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) for solutions.

```
cdk deploy --all --profile your-profile-name
```

You may also deploy the stacks individually (it is important to deploy the stack listed in the order below):

```
cdk deploy VpcStack  --profile your-profile-name
cdk deploy DatabaseStack  --profile your-profile-name
cdk deploy OpensearchStack --profile your-profile-name
cdk deploy DmsStack --profile your-profile-name
cdk deploy AppsyncStack --profile your-profile-name
cdk deploy FargateStack --profile your-profile-name
cdk deploy DataFetchStack --profile your-profile-name
```

## Step 4: Start DMS Replication

Now that the CDK has deployed all the resources you need to press a few buttons on the AWS console to start data replication.

1. At the [AWS online console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/console/home), enter `DMS` in the search bar. Click on the DMS icon.
