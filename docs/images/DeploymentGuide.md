# Requirements

Before you deploy, you must have the following installed on your device:

- [AWS Account](https://aws.amazon.com/account/)
- [GitHub Account](https://github.com/)
- [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)
- [AWS SAM](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-install.html)
- [MySQL Shell](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/shell/) (or `sudo apt install mysql-client-core-8.0` on Linux/WSL)

If you are on a Windows device, it is recommended to install the [Windows Subsystem For Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install), which lets you run a Linux terminal on your Windows computer natively. Some of the steps will require its use. [Windows Terminal](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/windows-terminal/9N0DX20HK701) is also recommended for using WSL.

# Step 1: Clone The Repository

First, clone the GitHub repository onto your machine. To do this:

1. Create a folder on your computer to contain the project code.
2. For an Apple computer, open Terminal. If on a Windows machine, open Command Prompt or Windows Terminal. Enter into the folder you made using the command `cd path/to/folder`. To find the path to a folder on a Mac, right click on the folder and press `Get Info`, then select the whole text found under `Where:` and copy with âŒ˜C. On Windows (not WSL), enter into the folder on File Explorer and click on the path box (located to the left of the search bar), then copy the whole text that shows up.
3. Clone the github repository by entering the following:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/UBC-CIC/VPRI-innovation-dashboard.git
```

The code should now be in the folder you created. Navigate into the folder containing the Amplify project by running the command:

```bash
cd VPRI-innovation-dashboard
```

# Step 2: Frontend Deployment

Before installing Amplify we need to create the IAM Role that gives us the permissions needed to implement this solution. Run the following line of code:

```bash
aws cloudformation deploy --template-file cfn-amplifyRole.yaml --stack-name amplifyconsole-vpri-backend-role --capabilities CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM
```

If you have multiple AWS Profiles, specify one with sufficient admin permissions by appending the following text to the end of the command, replacing the profile name with the profile you would like to use for the solution (If you do this, be sure to include the same `--profile` argument for the rest of the commands starting with `aws`. The profile you are using for this project should have administrator privliges).

```bash
--profile [PROFILE NAME]
```

This step creates the IAM role called **amplifyconsole-vpri-backend-role** that will be used on the next step.

The **Deploy to Amplify Console** button will take you to your AWS console to deploy the front-end solution.

1. On the AWS console. select your region on the top right, then connect to GitHub.
